UNIX
----

Building on UNIX-like operating systems requires GNU make 3.81 or later.
Most recent GNU/Linux distributions should already have this version
installed. To check the GNU make version run make (or gmake) with the
--version option.

Unless you are using the libcutl+dep package, you will also need to 
install the following dependencies:

  build   >= 0.3.5 http://kolpackov.net/projects/build/

The libcutl+dep package comes with the necessary dependencies bundled.

To build the library, tests, and examples simply run make in the root
directory of the package. To run the automated test suite, run 'make test'.
To clean the object files, executables, etc., run 'make clean'. To de-
configure the package (that is, remove configuration files in addition
to objects, executables, etc.), run 'make disfigure'.

To install the libcutl library, header files, and documentation use the
install target, for example:

$ make install_prefix=/usr install

You can fine-tune the installation locations with the following make
variables:

install_prefix       default is /usr/local
install_data_prefix  default is install_prefix
install_exec_prefix  default is install_prefix

install_bin_dir      default is install_exec_prefix/bin
install_sbin_dir     default is install_exec_prefix/sbin
install_lib_dir      default is install_exec_prefix/lib

install_data_dir     default is install_data_prefix/share
install_inc_dir      default is install_data_prefix/include

install_doc_dir      default is install_data_dir/doc
install_man_dir      default is install_data_dir/man
install_info_dir     default is install_data_dir/info


Windows
-------

Project and solution files are provided for Visual C++ 8.0 (2005) and 9.0
(2008). To build the libcutl library, open and build the corresponding
solution file in the cutl\ directory. After the build is complete, the
library can be found in the cutl\ directory.
