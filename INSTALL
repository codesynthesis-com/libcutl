UNIX
----

Building on UNIX-like operating systems requires GNU make 3.81 or later.
Most recent GNU/Linux distributions should already have this version
installed. To check the GNU make version run make (or gmake) with the
--version option.

Unless you are using the libcutl+dep package, you will also need to 
install the following dependencies:

  build   >= 0.3.4 http://kolpackov.net/projects/build/

The libcutl+dep package comes with the necessary dependencies bundled.

To build the library, tests, and examples simply run make in the root
directory of the package. To run the automated tests, run 'make test'.
To clean the object file, executables, etc., run 'make clean'. To de-
configure the package (that is, remove configuration files in addition
to objects, executables, etc.), run 'make disfigure'.


Windows
-------

Project and solution files are provided for Visual C++ 8.0 (2005) and 
9.0 (2008). To build the cutl library, open and build the corresponding
solution file in the cutl\ directory. After the build is complete, the
library can be found in the cutl\ directory.
